# Ice-Dataset-Analysis

## Description
Ice-Dataset-Analysis is a Python-based project that explores and analyzes ice cream ratings using data visualization and statistical techniques. This project aims to provide insights into consumer preferences and trends by leveraging tools like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and prepare data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends and patterns in the dataset.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Use libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create insightful plots.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on `Ice-Cream-Ratings.csv`, which contains ratings for different ice cream flavors. The dataset includes:
- Flavor names
- Ratings by multiple users
- Attributes such as sweetness, creaminess, and flavor intensity

## Key Visualizations
- Bar Charts: Compare average ratings by flavor.
- Heatmaps: Highlight correlations between attributes.
- Line Graphs: Show trends in ratings over time (if applicable).

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
